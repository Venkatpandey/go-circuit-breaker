# HTTP Client Resilience Simulation Results

## Overview

This document presents the results of a comprehensive HTTP client resilience simulation that demonstrates circuit breaker patterns, retry logic, and error handling in Go. The simulation uses a mock HTTP service to create realistic failure scenarios and test the robustness of the client implementation.

## Simulation Setup

- **Mock Service URL**: `http://127.0.0.1:57589`
- **Circuit Breaker Threshold**: 3 failures
- **Circuit Breaker Reset Timeout**: 5 seconds
- **Retry Configuration**: Maximum 3 attempts with exponential backoff
- **Base Retry Delay**: 200ms with jitter

## Test Results

### Test 1: Successful Requests (Low Failure Rate)

This test demonstrates the client's behavior under normal conditions with occasional failures that are successfully retried.

**Key Observations:**
- 5 requests attempted
- 3 requests required retries due to transient failures (429, 500 status codes)
- All retries succeeded on the second attempt
- Circuit breaker remained in `CLOSED` state throughout
- Failure count reset after each successful retry

**Request Details:**
- **Request 1-2**: Direct success
- **Request 3**: Failed with 429 → Retry succeeded
- **Request 4**: Failed with 429 → Retry succeeded
- **Request 5**: Failed with 500 → Retry succeeded

**Resilience Patterns Demonstrated:**
- ✅ Automatic retry with exponential backoff
- ✅ Circuit breaker failure tracking
- ✅ Successful recovery from transient errors

### Test 2: High Failure Rate (Circuit Breaker Activation)

This test simulates a degraded service with 80% failure rate to trigger circuit breaker protection.

**Critical Events:**
1. **Request 1**: Failed 3 consecutive times → Circuit breaker **OPENED**
2. **Requests 2-5**: All blocked by open circuit breaker
3. **Request 6**: Circuit breaker transitioned to **HALF-OPEN** after timeout
4. **Request 6**: Failed again → Circuit breaker **RE-OPENED**
5. **Requests 7-8**: Blocked by circuit breaker
